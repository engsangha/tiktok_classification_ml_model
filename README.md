With dummy data and a hypothetical case
TikTok users can report videos that they believe violate the platform's terms of service. 
Because there are millions of TikTok videos created and viewed every day, this means that many videos get reportedâ€”too many to be individually reviewed by a human moderator.

Analysis indicates that when authors do violate the terms of service, they're much more likely to be presenting a claim than an opinion. 
Therefore, it is useful to be able to determine which videos make claims and which videos are opinions.

TikTok wants to build a machine learning model to help identify claims and opinions. 
Videos that are labeled opinions will be less likely to go on to be reviewed by a human moderator. 
Videos that are labeled as claims will be further sorted by a downstream process to determine whether they should get prioritized for review. 
For example, perhaps videos that are classified as claims would then be ranked by how many times they were reported, then the top x% would be reviewed by a human each day.

A machine learning model would greatly assist in the effort to present human moderators with videos that are most likely to be in violation of TikTok's terms of service.

'claim_status' is the target variable

There will be a comparitive study between **Random Forest** Model and **XGBoost** Model and the champion model will be picked based on the evaluation metrics.

**EVALUATION METRICS:** 
False positives: When the model predicts a video is a claim when in fact it is an opinion
False negatives: When the model predicts a video is an opinion when in fact it is a claim
In the given scenario, it's better for the model to predict false positives when it makes a mistake, and worse for it to predict false negatives. It's very important to identify videos that break the terms of service, even if that means some opinion videos are misclassified as claims. The worst case for an opinion misclassified as a claim is that the video goes to human review. The worst case for a claim that's misclassified as an opinion is that the video does not get reviewed and it violates the terms of service. A video that violates the terms of service would be considered posted from a "banned" author, as referenced in the data dictionary.

Because it's more important to minimize false negatives, the model evaluation metric will be **recall**.
